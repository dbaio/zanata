# For Translators

It's preferable to use Zanata interface to translate documents.

If you want to translate documents through another tool, use always the `.po`
files, ignore `.pot` files, they are used only for Zanata.

[More information about pt_BR translation](https://github.com/doc-br/zanata/blob/master/README-pt_BR.md)


# For Zanata administrators

The `.pot` files are used as template/source for all languages.
In future we could generate them in the `en_US.ISO8859-1` directory in FreeBSD
Doc repository.

The Zanata Command line client (CLI) is the perfect way to connect to a Zanata
server to push and pull content.

## zanata-cli

You can download [zanata-cli here](http://docs.zanata.org/en/release/client/).

### config

To config your zanata-cli:

```SHELL
cat ~/.config/zanata.ini
[servers]
translate_zanata_org.url=https://translate.zanata.org/
translate_zanata_org.username=YOUR_USERNAME
translate_zanata_org.key=YOUR_KEY
```

### main commands
